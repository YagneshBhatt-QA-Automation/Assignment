Framework implements below best practices
=========================================
- Code reusability
- Code readability
- Scalable automation (demonstrated using multiple test classes)
- Uses explicit waits
- Abstraction layer for UI commands like click, sendkeys, etc.
- Parameterization using TestNG XML and config.properties
- Alternate Design approach [Without using inheritance]
- Exception handling [using Try/Catch and TestNG Listener]
- Abstraction layer for test data
- Abstraction layer for static text
- Supports iOS and Android
- Demonstrates how to define UI elements that are common across pages (e.g. menu bar, side bar, etc.)
- How to recover from test failure/ how to write fail safe test cases
- Scrolling for both Android and iOS (using touchaction, uiScrollable, mobile:scroll)
- Demonstrates how to effectively capture Screenshots/Videos
- Supports parallel execution on multiple real Android and iOS devices
- Integrated with Log4J2 Logging framework (supports basic as well as parallel logging)
- Integrated with Extent Reporting framework (supports parallel, screenshots, logging test steps)


# Test Plan for blazedemo Application
application which is helping to end customer for selecting flight and book it.

Below list of topics which going to help you for to define future testing & automation regression scope 


### For Smoke Test Cases, Please refer below basic check points. Need to check in every release.
   
* Flight from and to port verification
* Price Validation and select the flight
* Fill Customer details
* Confirmation Page validation


### For Regression Test Cases, Please refer below basic check points. Need to check in every release.


- Number of test cases for from and to port verification
- Number of test cases  select the flight
- Number of test cases for Fill Customer details
- Number of test cases for Confirmation Page validation and other details verification


### For Non Functional Testing, Please refer below basic check points. Need to check in every release.

- Application Performance
- Navigation of Application
- UI & Look Fill
- Network 4G, Wi-Fi 


### ISSUE/Observation
